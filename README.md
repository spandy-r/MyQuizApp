# MyQuizApp

I started learning java first, then I wanted to build something that has some application in real world. And android development fascinated me. So I started learning kotlin and this is the application that I made while learning about android development. 

#tech stack:
Kotlin and Xml

#features:
Removed action bar which enhanced the UI of the app.
Used a CardView in the Home page of the app(A widget).
It uses a EditText view to take input of the name of the person taking the quiz.
Created multiple activities for the questions.
There are mcqs, so whenever a correct option is chosen it displays green colour on it.
And whenever wrong answer is chosen ,it becomes red and shows the correct answer in green.
A variable maintains the count of correct answers, which is lastly intended to the result activity or result page where the score is displayed with the name registered at the homepage.

#What I have learned
I have learned about the manifest file.
Learned about the view models.
Creating our own class then using the object of that class.
Also moving over multiple screens.

#How will I improve
I can add a database to the app, which will in turn make the app more practical as it will create a leaderboard.

#What was most difficult part
Putting up the questions and also the correct answers, then turning the background of the option green and red.
